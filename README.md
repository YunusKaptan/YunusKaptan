## C# Language Course

I learned basic C# and advanced C# in this course. The course covered ADO.NET, Entity Framework, Design Pattern, Enterprise architecture. While following these lessons, I developed myself in C# by applying them in small projects.

An advanced course that covers topics such as AOP(aspect
oriented programming), dependency injection, SOLID principles,
design patterns, database relations, SPA(single page
applications) and many more.

2 demo projects completed.

Worked with C# and Angular (Typescript).

Projects were created in accordance with the SOLID principles
and Clean code.

Handled database connection with Entity Framework to
MSSQL(Microsoft SQL Server).

Autofac dependency injection container was used to resolve the
application's dependencies
